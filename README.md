# GuessMyNumber
Guess My Number is a quick, fun, and easy game. The User tries to guess the number from 1-20.

In this project, I have used basic HTML and CSS to style the page, and Javascript to program it.
In the field you can type in the number bethween 1-20, Everytime you guess wrong, your high score lowers down for 1 point.
If you are guessing the number that is higher than the guessed number, it will say "Too high!", and the same if you guess the lower number ->"Too low!"
Once you guess the correct number, the score you have on the right side will be saved to Highscore.
